Paysim synthetic dataset of mobile money transactions. Each step represents an hour of simulation. This dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset which is presented in the paper "PaySim: A financial mobile money simulator for fraud detection".





Cyber Frauds is the major problem which we are facing now a days, the rate at which Data is generating is very high and we are not able to manage that data by using traditional file System approaches. S o, by making use of Big Data and Soft Computing technologies we can create some algorithm which can go a long way in recognizing these fraud. While making an algorithm on the basis of some keyword and then will train and test it with the available data.
We are going to discuss many algorithms and concepts based on which we can predict whether the given mail, message, etc. is any Trojan or not.
